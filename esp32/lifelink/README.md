# LifeLink ESP32 Node

Firmware for the LifeLink LoRa mesh node. Runs on **Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3** (ESP32-S3 + SX1262). Users connect via BLE from a phone app, send a message, and the node runs a local decision tree to classify it as vital or normal before forwarding over LoRa.

## Overview

- **Bluetooth (BLE)**: Phone connects to the node over BLE. A 30-second timer drives periodic connection attempts when disconnected. Once connected, the node stays in standby until it receives a message; receiving a message triggers the decision tree (triage).
- **LoRa**: SX1262 radio for mesh messaging. Vital messages are sent as compact payloads; normal messages as full ASCII.
- **Decision tree**: Lightweight on-device classifier (vital vs normal, intent, urgency, etc.) exported from Python and run in C++ on the ESP32.

## Hardware

- **Board**: Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V3  
- **MCU**: ESP32-S3  
- **Radio**: SX1262 (915 MHz US / 868 MHz EU)  
- **Pins** (LoRa on HSPI): NSS=8, DIO1=14, RST=12, BUSY=13, SCK=9, MISO=11, MOSI=10  

## Code Layout

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/main.cpp` | Entry point: initializes LoRa node and Bluetooth, runs `tick()` for both. |
| `src/lifelink_lora_node.h` / `.cpp` | LoRa state machine (Idle, Tx, Rx, TxDone, RxDone, timeouts, errors), SX1262 via RadioLib. |
| `src/lifelink_bluetooth.h` / `.cpp` | BLE state machine (Disconnected, Connecting, Standby, MessageReceived), 30 s timer for connection attempts, Nordic UART-style RX characteristic; on message → decision tree hook. |

## LoRa State Machine

- **kIdle** → **kRx**: Start listening.
- **kRx** → **kRxDone** (packet OK), **kRxTimeout** (no packet), or **kRxError** (e.g. CRC).
- **kRxDone** → brief delay then **kTx**: send PING-style reply (or later: triage payload).
- **kTx** → **kTxDone** or **kTxTimeout**; **kTxDone** / **kTxTimeout** / **kRxTimeout** / **kRxError** → back to **kRx** (or **kTx** for first PING when no peers seen).

DIO1 is used as RadioLib’s operation-done interrupt.

## Bluetooth State Machine

- **kBtDisconnected**: BLE not connected. A timer (e.g. 30 s) triggers periodic “try connect” (start/restart advertising). No message handling.
- **kBtConnecting**: Advertising started; waiting for a client to connect.
- **kBtStandby**: Client connected. Waiting for the app to write a message to the BLE RX characteristic.
- **kBtMessageReceived**: A message was received. Run the decision tree (and later: format LoRa payload and hand off to LoRa). Then return to **kBtStandby**.

The 30 s period is implemented with a timer interrupt (or equivalent) that sets a flag; the main loop/tick checks the flag and, when in **kBtDisconnected**, (re)starts advertising.

## Build and Flash

```bash
cd esp32/lifelink
pio run
pio run -t upload
```

Serial monitor (115200):

```bash
pio device monitor
```

## Dependencies

- **RadioLib** (PlatformIO `lib_deps`): SX1262 driver.
- **ESP32 BLE** (Arduino-ESP32 built-in): `BLEDevice`, `BLEServer`, `BLECharacteristic`, etc.

## Decision Tree Integration

When the BLE state machine enters **kBtMessageReceived**, it has the raw text in a buffer. The intended flow is:

1. Encode text to the fixed feature vector (see `py_decision_tree`).
2. Run the exported C++ decision tree to get `is_vital`, `intent`, `urgency`, etc.
3. If vital → build compact payload and pass to LoRa for TX.
4. If normal → pass full ASCII to LoRa for TX.

The Bluetooth module exposes a callback or inline hook (e.g. `onMessageReceived(char* msg, size_t len)`) so `main` or the LoRa node can run the tree and queue the appropriate LoRa packet. The tree code itself can live in a separate module (e.g. `lifelink_decision_tree.h` generated by `export_cpp.py`).
